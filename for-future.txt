(
    socket listener input plugin to listen to stats reported from Python code, and
    input plugin for monitoring system resources consumption (?).
    use telegraf to watch it's own listen queue?

)

## What I might write about in next post:

- overloading TCP socket (Unix socket, UDP socket) with metrics, and checking out what happens
- looking into `read_buffer_size` in Telegraf config and system socket listen queue size
- techniques to measure dropped readings rate
- reporting stats of backend calls (`aiohttp` and `requests`)
- optimal uWSGI configurations, for best performance when all is good, and backend failure-resistant
- babel 7 configurations
- python tests in parallel
